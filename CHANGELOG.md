## 0.0.1

* TODO: Describe initial release.
## 0.1.5
The main changes are as following:
1. The new version do the page jump (URL route) based on the inherited FlutterViewController or Activity. The jump procedure will create new instance of FlutterView, while the old version just reuse the underlying FlutterView
2. Avoiding keeping and reusing the FlutterView, there is no screenshot and complex attach&detach logical any more. As a result, memory is saved and black or white-screen issue occured in old version all are solved.
3. This version also solved the app life cycle observation issue, we recommend you to use ContainerLifeCycle observer to listen the app enter background or foreground notification instead of WidgetBinding.
4. We did some code refactoring, the main logic became more straightforward.

### API changes
From the point of API changes, we did some refactoring as following:
#### iOS API changes
1. FlutterBoostPlugin's startFlutterWithPlatform function change its parameter from FlutterViewController to Engine
2. 
**Before change**
```objectivec
FlutterBoostPlugin
- (void)startFlutterWithPlatform:(id<FLBPlatform>)platform onStart:(void (^)(FlutterViewController *))callback;
```

**After change**

```objectivec
FlutterBoostPlugin2
- (void)startFlutterWithPlatform:(id<FLB2Platform>)platform
                         onStart:(void (^)(id<FlutterBinaryMessenger,
                                           FlutterTextureRegistry,
                                           FlutterPluginRegistry> engine))callback;

```

2. FLBPlatform protocol removed flutterCanPop、accessibilityEnable and added entryForDart
**Before change:**
```objectivec
@protocol FLBPlatform <NSObject>
@optional
//Whether to enable accessibility support. Default value is Yes.
- (BOOL)accessibilityEnable;
// flutter模块是否还可以pop
- (void)flutterCanPop:(BOOL)canpop;
@required
- (void)openPage:(NSString *)name
          params:(NSDictionary *)params
        animated:(BOOL)animated
      completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
- (void)closePage:(NSString *)uid
         animated:(BOOL)animated
           params:(NSDictionary *)params
       completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
@end
```
**After change:**
```objectivec
@protocol FLB2Platform <NSObject>
@optional
- (NSString *)entryForDart;
    
@required
- (void)open:(NSString *)url
   urlParams:(NSDictionary *)urlParams
        exts:(NSDictionary *)exts
      completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
- (void)close:(NSString *)uid
       result:(NSDictionary *)result
         exts:(NSDictionary *)exts
   completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion;
@end
```

#### Android API changes
Android mainly changed the IPlatform interface and its implementation.
It removed following APIs:
```java
Activity getMainActivity();
boolean startActivity(Context context,String url,int requestCode);
Map getSettings();
```

And added following APIs:

```java
void registerPlugins(PluginRegistry registry) 方法
void openContainer(Context context,String url,Map<String,Object> urlParams,int requestCode,Map<String,Object> exts);
void closeContainer(IContainerRecord record, Map<String,Object> result, Map<String,Object> exts);
IFlutterEngineProvider engineProvider();
int whenEngineStart();
```
